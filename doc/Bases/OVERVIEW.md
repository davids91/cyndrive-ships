## Fleet
Each base or carrier ship has a fleet of ships, whom the ones in battle are chosen from.

## Universe map
The player interacts with multiple aspects of the same world, battling ships/space-bases and a world overview map. 
The world overview displays the various planets, asteroids and bases at their respective locations centered around a black hole.
Stars are not displayed on the map, only the habitable areas, mainly for clarity.
Planets might be uninhabited, or have a base attached to them.
Additionally from the topological view, the player is able to modify the "date" of the map to see the same universe at different times.
A base can be attacked to be conquered, which leads to the battle aspect of the game. Once a base is defeated at a given date it will occupy the nearby planets space, collecting resources until it is defeated by someone, or a disaster clears the planet[[0]].
To keep adequate balance, traveling to longer distances in time also cost significant resources, to avoid a base collecting resources throughout the timeline and then traveling back to the beginning of time and eliminating everything else. 
A base colliding with its own timeline counts as a paradox and as defeat because it breaks the bases timeline.

### Map Entities
UI[[2]]
Planet_area: A habitable planet in a local solar system
Asteroid: A stable asteroid adequate for remote base operations

## Moving bases
Different planets provide different resources, so it is both logical and suggested for a base to move between planets.
Bases can move both in time and space, should the adequate fuels are acquired for them to do so. Time traveling positions are saved for each base, so every base has a different timeline. Should a base know its inevitable defeat it has the option to escape with its current resources to avoid destruction. In this case, any progress after the defeat timeline of the base is re-written.
To move in space a base needs to convert itself into a traveling base/ship, otherwise it can only move in time. In case a base stays around orbit of a planet, it moves with it without any resources drained.
