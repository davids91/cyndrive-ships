## Story
It is the year 0xBEEF! (we use hexadecimals now)
Humanity is finally exploring the wast universe with the help of the invention of Dr. Ann Stephanie: 
The Cyndrive engine! A giant spaceship mobilizer that doubles as a time-traveling device.
It is able to move its surroundings in time, both short and long term with the use of the rare mineral, Laupeerium.
The engine is also able to generate a paradox suppression field, which makes it possible to intertwine timelines
to make smaller fighter ships be present multiple times at the same time.

As it turns out proper self-driving capabilities could not be delivered to battleships before time travel was invented.
*sad elon noises*
In other, depressing news time travel is now used to make armies from a single induvidual,
instead of talking to dinosaurs or some shi(*cuts away*)
And the same guy is being sent to fight the same battle over and over again,
until eternity, so pretty much like being in IT. 10/10 No notes

Now I could invent a baddie at this point,
but it is pointless because humanity will always find a reason to break stuff in a cool way
and explode ships, polluting the environment. 
Except this time instead of the ocean we pollute the universe, because that is surely big enough for us to not care.

So there are multiple companies fighting for the exclusive use of Laupeerium,
and your goal is to not care about any of that and blow shit up.
The blown up enemies may drop technologies you can use to upgrade your fleet. That basically means different weapons.
And at the end of the game you win I guess, WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU DIPSHI(*cuts away*)

So get ready for an adventure of multiple lifetimes in the span of a few minutes,
because of time travel! get it? HA HA

Because Cyndrive ships'a'comin!
WOO!
