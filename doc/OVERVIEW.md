## Combat
A battle is inside an arena-like scene where the surrounding environment(planet, moons, space debris),
attacking and defending carrier ship is shown.
The combat lasts until either one of the bases are destroyed.
Upon destruction a carrier can decide to turn back time to the beginning of the combat
IF it has enough resources.
This reverts the arena to its starting state in an unstable time-bubble. 

The Cyndrive ships are duplicated, each move they have made in the previous turn are stored and played back,
while the new set of ships are now controlled by the player(s or bot(s)).
Paradox destruction effect is suppressed until a victor emerges,
but continued contact of a ship with its previous self weakens the paradox supression field and can make the ship implode.

Since the time-bubble is unstable ships destroyed in previous turns disappear, unless they are destroyed sooner.
In case a ship is destroyed within a battle it may survive it,
because of the unstable nature of the time-bubble the battle takes place.
The more turns a ship is destroyed, the more likely its destruction will transcend the time-bubble.
Stationary Bases are orbiting around their target planet, while traveling bases can move freely.
However attacking can only occur in a brief window of time, when the bases trajectory meet.

Both the player and the enemy base can restart the match, using up a time travel resource
The battle continues until either the base is destroyed, or the player can not restart the battle after death.
