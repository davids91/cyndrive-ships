# Overview
Ship battles intertwined through time; IN SPACE!! Woo

## Story
It's the year 0xBEEF! (we use hexadecimals now)
Humanity is finally exploring the wast universe with the help of the invention of Dr. Ann Stephanie: 
The Cyndrive engine! A giant spaceship mobilizer that doubles as a time-traveling device.
It is able to move its surroundings in time, both short and long term with the use of the rare mineral, Laupeerium.
The engine is also able to generate a paradox suppression field, which makes it possible to intertwine timelines
to make smaller fighter ships be present multiple times at the same time.

As it turns out proper self-driving capabilities could not be delivered to battleships before time travel was invented.
*sad elon noises*
In other, depressing news time travel is now used to make armies from a single induvidual,
instead of talking to dinosaurs or some shi(*cuts away*)
Now I could invent a baddie at this point,
but it is pointless because humanity will always find a reason to break stuff in a cool way
and explode ships, polluting the environment. Except this time instead of the ocean we pollute the universe.
Because that is surely big enough for us to not care.

So there are multiple companies fighting for the exclusive use of Laupeerium, so your goal is to not care about that
and blow up shi(*cuts away*).
The blown up enemies may drop technologies you can use to upgrade your fleet. That basically means different weapons.

## Documentation structure
The two slices of the game are called Bases and Battles. Despite the two being intertwined,
the games they represent are valid on their own.
